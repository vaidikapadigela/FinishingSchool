// In a software development company, a team works on various projects over n weeks. 
// The team completes a certain number of tasks tasks[i] each week and dedicates 
// hours[i] hours of work. Given an integer k, for every consecutive sequence of 
// k weeks (tasks[i], tasks[i+1], ..., tasks[i+k-1] and 
// hours[i], hours[i+1], ..., hours[i+k-1] for all 0 <= i <= n-k), 
// they evaluate T, the total number of tasks completed during that sequence 
// of k weeks, and E, the total hours of work during that sequence of k weeks:

// a) If T < lower and E >= work_goal, the team performed very poorly and loses 2 points
// b) If T < lower and E < work_goal, the team performed poorly and loses 1 point.
// c) If T >= upper and E >= work_goal, the team performed well and gains 1 point.
// d) If T >= upper and E < work_goal, the team performed exceptionally well and gains 2 points.
// e) Otherwise, the team's performance is normal and there is no change in points.

// Initially, the team starts with zero points. Return the total number of points 
// the team has after working for n weeks. Note that the total points can be negative.

// Example 1
// Input:
// n = 5
// tasks = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
// hours = [30, 20, 10, 30, 40]
// k = 2
// lower = 35
// upper = 70
// work_goal = 45

// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// For [10, 20] and [30, 20]:
// T = 30 < lower and E = 50 >= work_goal, the team performed very poorly and loses 2 points.

// For [20, 30] and [20, 10]:
// T = 50 >= lower and T <= upper and E = 30 < work_goal, no change in points.

// For [30, 40] and [10, 30]:
// T = 70 = upper and E = 40 < work_goal, the team performed exceptionally well and 
// gains 2 points.

// For [40, 50] and [30, 40]:
// T = 90 > upper and E = 70 >= work_goal, the team performed well and gains 1 point.

// Therefore, the team gains 1 point (0 - 2 + 2 + 1 = 1).

// Sample Input=
// 4	//n
// 5 8 10 15
// 25 30 20 25
// 3	//k
// 25	//lower
// 40	//upper
// 60	//work_goal
// Sample Output=
// -2
