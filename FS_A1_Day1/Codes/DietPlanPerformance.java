/*A dieter records the number of calories they consume each day in an array calories, 
where calories[i] represents the calories consumed on the i-th day. 

Given an integer k, the dieter evaluates every consecutive sequence of k days. 
(i.e., calories[i], calories[i+1], ..., calories[i+k-1] for all 0 <= i <= n-k). 

For each sequence, they calculate the total calories consumed, denoted as T:
    * If T < lower, the dieter performed poorly on their diet and loses 1 point.
    * If T > upper, the dieter performed well on their diet and gains 1 point.
    * Otherwise, the dieter performed normally, and there is no change in points.

The dieter starts with zero points. 
After evaluating all sequences of k days, return the total number of points the dieter has. 

Note that the total points can be negative.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer n, represents calories size
Line-2: Space separated n integers, represents calories[]
Line-3: An integer, represents number of days
Line-4: An integer, represents lower value
Line-5: An integer, represents upper value

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: An integer

Sample Input 1:
---------------
5
1 2 3 4 5
1
3
3

Sample Output 1:
----------------
0

Explanation: 
------------
Since k = 1, each element of the array is evaluated individually:
    *calories[0] = 1 and calories[1] = 2 are less than lower, so 2 points are lost.
    *calories[3] = 4 and calories[4] = 5 are greater than upper, so 2 points are gained.
    *The net change in points is 0.

Sample Input 2:
---------------
2
3 2
2
0
1

Sample Output 2:
----------------
1

Explanation: 
------------
Since k = 2, the only sequence is calories[0] + calories[1] = 5, which is greater than upper. 
Thus, 1 point is gained.

Sample Input 3:
---------------
4
6 5 0 0
2
1
5

Sample Output 3:
----------------
0

Explanation: 
------------
*calories[0] + calories[1] = 11 > upper, so 1 point is gained.
*calories[1] + calories[2] = 5 is within the range [lower, upper], so no change in points.
*calories[2] + calories[3] = 0 < lower, so 1 point is lost.
*The net change in points is 0.


Constraints:
------------
1) 1 <= k <= calories.length <= 10^5
2) 0 <= calories[i] <= 20000
3) 0 <= lower <= upper
